### 🧠 Who Am I?

> “I’m not a code monkey. I’m a Jedi, like my mentor before me.”

Hey there! I’m a **machine-learning-loving, deep-space-dreaming, full-stack-forging** developer who's always on a quest—whether that’s fighting dark patterns on the web, decoding medical images, or building game worlds pixel by pixel.

🕹️ **Gamedev Padawan** | 🧬 **AI Jedi-in-Training** | 🎮 **Unreal Explorer**
